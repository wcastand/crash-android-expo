CRASH ANDROID


only crashes on real device (emulator seems to work properly)

- bun install
- bun expo prebuild --clean --platform android
- bun android --device (choose a real device)


the app will build without error and launch but when it's going to try to downlaod the bundle to launch the app, it will crash on a white screen.
